        This configuration, combined with android:usesCleartextTraffic="true" 
        in the AndroidManifest.xml, ensures that cleartext HTTP traffic is 
        permitted for all domains. This is generally suitable for debug/development 
        builds where you might connect to local HTTP servers with dynamic IPs.

        For RELEASE builds, ensure your BuildConfig points to HTTPS URLs.
