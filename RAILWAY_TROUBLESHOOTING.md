# Railway Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## üöÇ **Why Railway Isn't Detecting Your Repository**

If Railway isn't detecting your BEAR-SYSTEM repository, here are the most common causes and solutions:

---

## üîç **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: Repository Not Public**

**Problem:** Railway can't access private repositories on free accounts

**Solution:**
1. Go to [https://github.com/Shinji0908/BEAR-SYSTEM](https://github.com/Shinji0908/BEAR-SYSTEM)
2. Click "Settings" ‚Üí "General"
3. Scroll down to "Danger Zone"
4. Click "Change repository visibility"
5. Select "Public"
6. Confirm the change

### **Issue 2: GitHub Account Not Connected**

**Problem:** Railway doesn't have access to your GitHub account

**Solution:**
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "Login" ‚Üí "Login with GitHub"
3. Authorize Railway to access your repositories
4. Make sure you grant all necessary permissions

### **Issue 3: Repository Not Found**

**Problem:** Railway can't find your repository

**Solutions:**
1. **Check repository name:** Make sure it's exactly `BEAR-SYSTEM`
2. **Check repository URL:** https://github.com/Shinji0908/BEAR-SYSTEM
3. **Refresh Railway:** Try logging out and back in
4. **Check permissions:** Make sure Railway has access to your account

### **Issue 4: Repository Structure Issues**

**Problem:** Railway can't detect the project structure

**Solutions:**
1. **Check package.json files:** Make sure they exist in root, bear-backend, and bear-frontend
2. **Check file structure:** Verify the monorepo structure is correct
3. **Check git commits:** Make sure all files are committed and pushed

## üöÄ **Step-by-Step Railway Setup**

### **Step 1: Verify Repository Access**

1. **Go to Railway:** [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **Login with GitHub:** Make sure you're logged in
3. **Check repositories:** You should see your repositories listed
4. **Look for BEAR-SYSTEM:** It should appear in the list

### **Step 2: Create New Project**

1. **Click "New Project"**
2. **Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. **Find BEAR-SYSTEM** in the list
4. **Click on it** to select
5. **Railway should detect** the project structure

### **Step 3: Configure Services**

Railway should detect:
- **Backend service** (Node.js)
- **Frontend service** (React)

If it doesn't detect automatically:
1. **Add service manually**
2. **Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. **Choose BEAR-SYSTEM**
4. **Set root directory** to `bear-backend` for backend
5. **Set root directory** to `bear-frontend` for frontend

---

## üîß **Manual Configuration**

### **If Railway Still Can't Detect:**

#### **Backend Service:**
1. **Create new service**
2. **Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. **Choose BEAR-SYSTEM repository**
4. **Set root directory:** `bear-backend`
5. **Railway will detect:** Node.js project

#### **Frontend Service:**
1. **Create new service**
2. **Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. **Choose BEAR-SYSTEM repository**
4. **Set root directory:** `bear-frontend`
5. **Railway will detect:** React project

## üìã **Repository Checklist**

### **Verify Your Repository Has:**

- [ ] **README.md** - Main documentation
- [ ] **package.json** - Root package file
- [ ] **bear-backend/package.json** - Backend dependencies
- [ ] **bear-frontend/package.json** - Frontend dependencies
- [ ] **railway.json** - Railway configuration
- [ ] **bear-backend/railway.json** - Backend config
- [ ] **bear-frontend/railway.json** - Frontend config
- [ ] **All files committed** and pushed to GitHub

### **Check Repository URL:**
- **Correct URL:** https://github.com/Shinji0908/BEAR-SYSTEM
- **Repository is public**
- **All files are pushed**
- **No uncommitted changes**

## üõ†Ô∏è **Alternative Deployment Methods**

### **If Railway Still Doesn't Work:**

#### **Option 1: Deploy Individual Services**
1. **Deploy backend first**
2. **Deploy frontend second**
3. **Connect them manually**

#### **Option 2: Use Railway CLI**
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Deploy from local directory
railway deploy
```

#### **Option 3: Use Other Platforms**
- **Vercel** - For frontend
- **Heroku** - For backend
- **DigitalOcean** - For full stack
